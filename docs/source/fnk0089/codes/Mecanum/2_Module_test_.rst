2.1 Motor
***********************************

Motor
===================================

A motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Motor consists of two parts: stator and rotor. When motor works, the stationary part is stator, and the rotating part is rotor. Stator is usually the outer case of motor, and it has terminals to connect to the power. Rotor is usually the shaft of motor, and can drive other mechanical devices to run. Diagram below is a small DC motor with two pins.

When a motor is connected to the power supply, it will rotate in one direction. Reverse the polarity of power supply, then the motor rotates in opposite direction.

PWM
==================================

PWM, Pulse Width Modulation, uses digital pins to send certain frequencies of square waves, that is, the output of high levels and low levels, which alternately last for a while. The total time for each set of high levels and low levels is generally fixed, which is called the period (the reciprocal of the period is frequency). The time of high level outputs are generally called "pulse width", and the duty cycle is the percentage of the ratio of pulse duration, or pulse width (PW) to the total period (T) of the waveform.

The longer the output of high levels last, the larger the duty cycle and the higher the corresponding voltage in analog signal will be. The following figures show how the analogs signal voltage vary between 0V-5V (high level is 5V) corresponding to the pulse width 0%-100%:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_02.png
    :align: center

The longer the PWM duty cycle is, the higher the output power will be. Now that we understand this relationship, we can use PWM to control the brightness of an LED or the speed of DC motor and so on.

Schematic
==================================

The PWM control signal of this car is provided by Pico (W) with the RP2040_PWM library. RP2040_PWM library, the PWM library of Pico (W), uses Hardware-PWM module on RP2040-based boards to create and output the PWM of any GPIO pin. These purely hardware-based PWM channels can generate from very low (lowest is 7.5Hz * (F_CPU/125)) to very high PWM frequencies (in the MHz range, up to (F_CPU/2) or 62.5MHz).  The reason why we use this library is that it is based on hardware-PWM channels, so its operation will not be blocked by bad-behaving software functions / tasks.

The schematic of the motor module is shown below:

After downloading the code, place the car in an open area and you can see that the car is repeatedly moving forward and backward, rotating left and right, and moving in different directions.

Code Explanation
-------------------------------------

If you are not familiar with Arduino IDE, you can visit https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/ to learn more. 

Add the header file of the car. Each time before controlling the car, please add header file first.

    :lines: 11-11
    :dedent:

Loop function can be used repeatedly in the program. The Motor_M_Move() function is used here to make the car move forward, backward, left, and right, and to translate in different directions

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    Motor_M_Move(50, 50, 50, 50);  //Farward

    Motor_M_Move(-50, -50, -50, -50);  //Backward

    Motor_M_Move(-50, -50, 50, 50);  //Turn left

    Motor_M_Move(50, 50, -50, -50);  //Turn right

    Motor_M_Move(-50, 50, -50, 50);  //Move left

    Motor_M_Move(50, -50, 50, -50);  //Move right

    Motor_M_Move(-50, 50, -50, 50);  //Move diagonally upward to the left

    Motor_M_Move(0, -50, 0, -50);  //Move diagonally downward to the right

    Motor_M_Move(50, 0, 50, 0);  //Move diagonally upward to the right

    Motor_M_Move(-50, 0, -50, 0);  //Move diagonally downward to the left

Motor_Move_Init function is to control the car. The four parameters m1_speed, m2_speed, m3_speed, m4_speed range from -100 to 100. When the value is positive number, the motors move forward. Otherwise, they move backwards. m1_speed, m2_speed represent the two motors on the left and m3_speed, m4_speed embody those on the right. 

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    void Motor_Move_Init(int m1_speed, int m2_speed, int m3_speed, int m4_speed);

The Motor_M_Move function is used to control the car, and the four speeds input will be transferred to make the car move.

Now, let's explore how the car accomplishes omnidirectional movement. Drawing from the earlier discussion on mecanum wheel installation, we understand that these wheels can generate two sets of diagonal 45-degree velocities. Each velocity can further be decomposed into two components: one along the X-axis and the other along the Y-axis.

Let's take a closer look at the function "Motor_M_Move(-50, 50, -50, 50)" mentioned in line sixteen, which enables the car to move to the left. In this function, the parameters represent the speed and direction of each of the four wheels. Specifically, M1 to M4 rotate in the following sequence: backward, forward, backward, and forward.

Since the speed of all four wheels is equal at 50, the X-axis and Y-axis components of the velocity are also equal. On one side of the car, two wheels generate a forward and a backward velocity, effectively canceling each other out. However, this results in a solitary leftward velocity component. The leftward velocities from both sides combine, thus moving the car laterally to the left.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Mecanum/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_00.png
    :align: center

If your car is moving in the opposite direction of the programmed direction, you can change the motor rotation direction of the motors through micro definition. Take the motor M1 as an example, modify the macro definition in the "Freenove_4WD_Car_For_Pico_W.h" file to "#define REVERSE_MOTOR1".

2.2 Servo
*********************************

Servo
=================================

Servo is a compact package, which consists of a DC motor, a set of reduction gears to provide torque, a sensor and control circuit board. Most servos only have a 180-degree range of motion via their "horn". Servos can output higher torque than a simple DC motor alone and they are widely used to control motion in model cars, model airplanes, robots, etc. Servos have three wire leads that usually terminate to a male or female 3-pin plug. Two leads are for electric power: positive (2-VCC, Red wire), negative (3-GND, Brown wire), and the signal line (1-Signal, Orange wire), as represented in the Servo provided in your Kit.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_06.png
    :align: center

We will use a 50Hz PWM signal with a duty cycle in a certain range to drive the Servo. The lasting time of 0.5ms-2.5ms of PWM single cycle high level corresponds to the servo angle 0 degrees - 180 degree linearly. Part of the corresponding values are as follows:

.. table:: 
    :class: freenove-ow

    +-----------------+-------------+
    | High level time | Servo angle |
    +=================+=============+
    | 0.5ms           | 0 degree    |
    +-----------------+-------------+
    | 1ms             | 45 degree   |
    +-----------------+-------------+
    | 1.5ms           | 0 degree    |
    +-----------------+-------------+
    | 2ms             | 45 degree   |
    +-----------------+-------------+
    | 2.5ms           | 180 degree  |
    +-----------------+-------------+

When you change the servo signal value, the servo will rotate to the designated angle.

Schematic

    void Servo_Sweep(int servo_id, int angle_start, int angle_end);

2.3 Buzzer
*********************************

Buzzer
==================================

Buzzer is a sounding component, which is widely used in electronic devices such as calculator, electronic warning clock and alarm. Buzzer has two types: active and passive. Active buzzer has oscillator inside, which will sound as long as it is supplied with power. Passive buzzer requires external oscillator signal (generally use PWM with different frequency) to make a sound.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_09.png
    :align: center

Active buzzer is easy to use. Generally, it can only make a specific frequency of sound. Passive buzzer requires an external circuit to make a sound, but it can be controlled to make a sound with different frequency. The resonant frequency of the passive buzzer is 2kHz, which means the passive buzzer is loudest when its resonant frequency is 2kHz.

:red:`How to identify active and passive buzzer`

1.	Usually, there is a label on the surface of active buzzer covering the vocal hole, but this is not an absolute judgment method.

2.	Active buzzers are more complex than passive buzzers in their manufacture. There are many circuits and crystal oscillator elements inside active buzzers; all of this is usually protected with a waterproof coating (and a housing) exposing only its pins from the underside. On the other hand, passive buzzers do not have protective coatings on their underside. From the pin holes viewing of a passive buzzer, you can see the circuit board, coils, and a permanent magnet (all or any combination of these components depending on the model.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_10.png
    :align: center

The buzzer used in this car is a passive buzzer that can make sounds with different frequence.

Schematic
=================================

As we can see, the buzzer is controlled by GPIO2 of Raspberry Pi Pico W. When the buzzer receives PWM signal, NPN will be activated to make the buzzer sound. When the buzzer receives no signal, it will be controlled at low level by R2 and NPN will not be activated, so the buzzer will not make any sounds. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_11.png
    :align: center

Sketch
================================

In this section, we will test the buzzer to make it sound like an alarm.

Open "01.3_Buzzer" folder in the "Freenove_4WD_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi_Pico\\Mecanum_wheels\\Sketches", and then double-click "01.3_Buzzer.ino".

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    void Buzzer_Alert(int beat, int rebeat);//Buzzer alarm function

2.4 ADC Module
*********************************

ADC
==========================

ADC is an electronic integrated circuit used to convert analog signals such as voltages to digital or binary form consisting of 1s and 0s. The range of our ADC on Raspberry Pi Pico (W) is 10 bits, that means the resolution is 2^10=1024, and it represents a range (at 3.3V) will be divided equally to 1024 parts. The rage of analog values corresponds to ADC values. So the more bits the ADC has, the denser the partition of analog will be and the greater the precision of the resulting conversion.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_14.png
    :align: center

Subsection 1: the analog in rang of 0V---3.3/1023 V corresponds to digital 0;

Subsection 2: the analog in rang of 3.3/1023 V---2*3.3 /1023V corresponds to digital 1;

The following analog will be divided accordingly.

The conversion formula is as follows:

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{ADC\ Value} = \frac{\boldsymbol{Analog\ Voltage}}{\boldsymbol{3.3}} \times \boldsymbol{1023}

Serial Communication
===============================

Serial communication uses one data cable to transfer data one bit by another in turn. Parallel communication means that the data is transmitted simultaneously on multiple cables. Serial communication takes only a few cables to exchange information between systems, which is especially suitable for computers to computers, long distance communication between computers and peripherals. Parallel communication is faster, but it requires more cables and higher cost, so it is not appropriate for long distance communication.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_15.png
    :align: center

Serial communication generally refers to the Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART), which is commonly used in electronic circuit communication. It has two communication lines; one is responsible for sending data (TX line) and the other for receiving data (RX line). The serial communication connections of two devices use is as follows:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_16.png
    :align: center

For serial communication, the baud rate in both sides must be the same. The baud rates commonly used are 9600 and 115200.

Computer identifies serial devices connected to your computer as COMx. We can use the Serial Monitor window of Arduino Software to communicate with Freenove control board.

Schematic
===============================

As we can see, the car reads the voltage of the batteries through GPIO26 of Raspberry Pi Pico (W). 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_17.png
    :align: center

The voltage acquisition range of GPIO26 on Raspberry Pi Pico W is 0-3.3V, while the car is powered by two 18650-lithium batteries, whose voltage is 8.4V when they are fully charged, which exceeds the acquisition range of Raspberry Pi Pico (W). Therefore, after passing through the voltage divider circuit composed of R3 and R4, the voltage at A0 will be about 1/4 of the battery voltage, 8.4/4=2.1V, which is within the voltage collection range of GPIO26.

Sketch
==============================

In this section, we will use GPIO26 of Raspberry Pi Pico (W) to read the voltage value of the batteries and print it on serial monitor. Open "01.4_Battery_level" folder in "Freenove_4WD_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi_Pico\\Mecanum_wheels\\Sketches" and then double-click "01.4_Battery_level.ino".

2.5 LED Matrix
********************************

LED Matrix
================================

A LED matrix is a rectangular display module that consists of a uniform grid of LEDs. The following is an 8X8 monochrome LED matrix containing 64 LEDs (8 rows by 8 columns).

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_21.png
    :align: center

In order to facilitate the operation and reduce the number of ports required to drive this component, the positive poles of the LEDs in each row and negative poles of the LEDs in each column are respectively connected together inside the LED matrix module, which is called a common anode. There is another arrangement type. Negative poles of the LEDs in each row and the positive poles of the LEDs in each column are respectively connected together, which is called a common cathode.

The LED matrix is common anode. As we can see from the schematic above, the anode of LED matrix is connected to ROWx of HT16K33 chip, and the cathode is connected to COMx. The address of HT16K33 chip is (0x70+[A2:A0]), and the default address of LED matrix is 0x71. If you want to change the address, you can use a knife to cut the connecting line in the middle of A0, or connect A1/A2.

    :align: center

The data on the left of the LED matrix are stored together and end with "----x", and the data on the right are stored together and end with "----y". Copy these two sets of dot matrix data and replace the array content in "01.5_Matrix.ino".

Open the folder "01.5_Matrix" in the "Freenove_4WD_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi_Pico\\Mecanum_wheels\\Sketches" and double click "01.5_Matrix.ino"

Code
--------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Mecanum_wheels/Sketches/01.5_Matrix/01.5_Matrix.ino
    :linenos:
    :language: c
    :dedent:

Copy and paste the array generated by the auxiliary applet to the program, and then click upload.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_40.png
    :align: center

You can see the LED matrix keep blinking.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_41.png
    :align: center

Code Explanation
--------------------------

Add the header file of LED matrix. Each time before controlling LED matrix, please add its header file first.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Mecanum_wheels/Sketches/01.5_Matrix/01.5_Matrix.ino
    :linenos:
    :language: c
    :lines: 7-7
    :dedent:

Apply for an Freenove_VK16K33 object and name it matrix.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Mecanum_wheels/Sketches/01.5_Matrix/01.5_Matrix.ino
    :linenos:
    :language: c
    :lines: 9-9
    :dedent:

Define IIC address and IIC pins of HT16K33 chip. Call init() function to initialize it and call setBlink() to set the LED matrix not blink.

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    Freenove_VK16K33 matrix = Freenove_VK16K33();
    ...
    matrix.init(0x71);
    matrix.setBlink(VK16K33_BLINK_OFF);

Define count to calculate the number of one-dimensional arrays contained in the two-dimensional x_array, and use the for loop to call the showStaticArray() function to continuously display the content of LED matrix. 

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    int count = sizeof(x_array) / sizeof(x_array[0]);
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
    {
        matrix.showStaticArray(x_array[i], y_array[i]);
        delay(delay_ms);
    }

2.6 LED
*************************

LED
=========================

Red, green, and blue are called the three primary colors. When you combine these three primary colors of different brightness, it can produce almost all kinds of visible light.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_42.png
    :align: center

The LED of the car is composed of eight LED, each of which is controlled by one pin and supports cascading. Each LED can emit three basic colors of red, green and blue, and supports 256-level brightness adjustment, which means that each LED can emit 2^24=16,777,216 different colors.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Mecanum/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_02.png
    :align: center

Schematic
=========================

As shown below, the DOUT of each LED is connected with DIN of the next LED, and the 8 LED can be controlled to emit colorful colors by inputting control signals through LED. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Standard/2_Module_test_/Chapter02_44.png
